clcb-ensembl
============

That class provides read access to essential tables in the Ensembl
core matrices. The objects nicely capsule the relational tables of the
MySQL database. All iterators and set operations are provided by Lisp,
sequence intervals that represent protein features are contributed to
the language by CLCB.

All classes and methods in clcb-ensembl should already have a
documentation string. Many also give explicit examples on their usage.
In ../doc some rogue documentation is evolving that presents
the functionality of CLCB in a larger context.
