Installation of CLCB
====================

A Lisp interpreter is required, tested for compatibility was only
sbcl. Under Debian Linux this is installed by calling

   aptitude install sbcl cl-asdf cl-closer-mop cl-split-sequence \
   			cl-ppcre cl-iterate

For complete functionality, several additional packages 
are required that are no yet availabie in Debian:

alexandria : http://common-lisp.net/project/alexandria/
moptilies : http://common-lisp.net/project/moptilities/

To install the still missing packages, it is suggested to use
the installer provided by asdf. That process is described at
http://www.cliki.net/ASDF-Install. From the lisp shell execute

 (require 'asdf)
 (require 'asdf-install)
 (asdf-install:install 'moptilities)
 (asdf-install:install 'alexandria)
