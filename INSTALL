Installation of CLCB
====================

A Lisp interpreter is required, tested for compatibility was only
sbcl. Under Debian Linux this is installed by calling

   aptitude install sbcl cl-asdf cl-closer-mop cl-split-sequence \
   			cl-ppcre cl-iterate

For complete functionality, several additional packages 
are required that are no yet availabie in Debian:

alexandria : http://common-lisp.net/project/alexandria/
moptilies : http://common-lisp.net/project/moptilities/

To install the still missing packages, it is suggested to use
the installer provided by asdf. That process is described at
http://www.cliki.net/ASDF-Install. From the lisp shell execute

 (require 'asdf)
 (require 'asdf-install)
 (asdf-install:install 'moptilities)
 (asdf-install:install 'alexandria)

For the startup, some settings are likely to be beneficial to be made
as an initalisation file. Such is constructed by the shell script
'bin/userinit.sh'. When first started, that script's output should be
pasted into the Lisp shell. At the time of writing, the shell, despite
these settings, still is required to be started from the root directory
of CLCB.
